# luksmnt
Mount LUKS encrypted disk images more easily(?)

Intended to be used as a target executable to open disk images encrypted with LUKS directly from the file manager.
This could not be achieved with a shell script since linux ignores setuid bits on interpreted executables.

Obviously very roughly put together on an evening, probably won't see much more in the way of edits
